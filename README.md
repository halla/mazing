# Mazing

This is a project that explores the Elixir programming language and related
libraries and tools through mazes.


* Graph traversal algorithms
  * Depth-first search
  * Breadth-first search
* Maze algorithms
  * Binary tree
  * Sidewinder
* OTP
  * Maze state is a persistent world populated by autonomous agents
* Agents
  * Movement inside maze
  * Trails
* Umbrella project
  * Web ui separated from mazing app itself
  * Probably overkill...

The maze is populated with autonomous agents, implemented as GenServers.

This project is inspired by the book _Mazes for programmers_ by Jamis Buck.

## Installation

* Haven't tried yet...
* git clone
* the normal stuff... (mix deps.get, mix phx.server...)
* see the running maze in your browser
